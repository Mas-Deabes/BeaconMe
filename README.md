#NEA-Coursework (Project Name : BeaconMe)
Description:

This App will allow a student to access their normal timetable (and possibly resources and content related to their courses) on a dashboard like interface where they will be able to check their timetable , if any valid input to the timetable is pressed (VALID MEANING PRESSING the time of an actual lesson not EMPTY slots) then the app will open up a Compass like application , directing the user to the room that has been selected through the arrow , There will be an option of being directed to rooms not in the timetables (For example the principal's office or the restroom ect.)

#Observation of Existing System :

A Smartphone

A Google Beacon Device

Objectives:

A Login system (if a user doesn't have an account then registration then)

The ability to access a dashboard like enviroment and customise the content to the user's liking

To Add the Name of the class and automatically assigning the timetable to the student (through the help of the data stored in the database)

A Version of the client will be made for the teacher where they will be able to change the room incase of room changes and remove the lesson from the timetable in case of staff member absence

A Notfication will be sent to the student in case of room change or the cancellation of a lesson

The App will have to detect the google beacon devices and quickly figure out where it is

The implementation of Dijkstra's short path algorithm to find the quickest path from the current location (Through the usage of a beacon device and triangulation)

once a user has arrived to let them know they are in front of the room through a warning on the app itself
