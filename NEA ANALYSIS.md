# NEA-Coursework

The Coursework will consist of a 3D mario game which will allows the user to play 5 different levels starting from easy to very hard 

The game will be composed of a few sections 

1) Login system , every player will be required to create an account then login [credentials will be saved on the database]

2) A Main Menu to allow the users to interact with the game and allow them to customise the skin of the playable character and to initiate the game etc.

3) 5 playable levels from easy to hard, the player will be able to obtain POWER-UPS throughout the level and use them to progress throughout the level

4) The Last Level (level 5) is the Boss Level (hardest) where the player will attempt to save his brother Luigi from the kidnapping of his enemy.

5) For a completed level a record of the attemps and the time taken to complete the level will be recorded to the database where it will be displayed on the leaderboard at the completion of the level 

6) The implementation of Artificial Intelligence for the boss level [maybe even the normal small threads like Goomba etc.]

7) Maybe Add Controller Support for those who wish to play with a controller (An API might be used for this cause)
